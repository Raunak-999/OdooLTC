# StackIt UI Fixes - Missing Buttons & Interactive Elements

## üéØ Problem Analysis

The StackIt Q&A platform is functionally working but has critical UI/UX issues that prevent users from properly interacting with the application. Based on the current screenshot, several essential interactive elements are missing or not properly displayed.

## üö® Critical Issues to Fix

### Issue 1: Missing "Ask Question" Button
**Problem**: Users have no visible way to create new questions
**Current State**: No prominent call-to-action button for question creation
**Impact**: Core functionality is hidden from users

**Required Solution**:
- Add a prominent "Ask Question" button in the main header area
- Position it near the top-right, before or after the Sign In/Sign Up buttons
- Use primary blue styling (bg-blue-600) to make it stand out
- Should be visible on all pages, especially the home page
- Include a "+" icon from Heroicons for visual clarity
- Button should navigate to `/ask-question` route

### Issue 2: Missing Vote Buttons (Up/Down Arrows)
**Problem**: Vote functionality exists but buttons are not visible
**Current State**: Shows vote count "0" but no interactive arrows
**Impact**: Users cannot vote on questions or answers

**Required Solution**:
- Add visible upvote/downvote arrow buttons on question cards
- Position arrows vertically on the left side of each question card
- Use ChevronUpIcon and ChevronDownIcon from @heroicons/react
- Display vote count between the arrows
- Arrows should be clickable and show hover states
- Highlight arrows when user has already voted (green for upvote, red for downvote)
- Disable voting on user's own content

### Issue 3: Question Content Not Displaying Properly
**Problem**: Question titles and content appear empty or truncated
**Current State**: Question card shows minimal information
**Impact**: Users cannot see what questions are about

**Required Solution**:
- Ensure question titles are prominently displayed and clickable
- Show question description preview (first 2-3 lines)
- Display all question tags as colored pills
- Make entire question card clickable to navigate to detail view
- Show question metadata (author, timestamp, view count)

### Issue 4: Missing Interactive Elements on Question Cards
**Problem**: Question cards lack proper interactive elements
**Current State**: Static display without clear actions
**Impact**: Poor user experience and engagement

**Required Solution**:
- Add hover effects on question cards (subtle shadow increase)
- Make question titles clickable links with proper styling
- Add "View Question" or "Read More" link if content is truncated
- Include author profile links (clickable usernames)
- Show proper timestamps with relative time (e.g., "2 hours ago")
